"""Read symbols out of KiCad's stock libraries.

Two jobs. First, flatten a symbol into a self-contained definition, because a
schematic's `lib_symbols` block cannot rely on a parent that lives in some
other file -- and a lot of the stock parts are derived (CD4066BM extends
CD4066BE). Second, report where each pin's connection point sits, so wires can
be drawn to real coordinates instead of guessed ones.
